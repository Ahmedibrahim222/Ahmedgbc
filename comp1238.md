## Week 1 - History
- One writing system can be used by many languages
- Cuneiform looks weird
- The Epic of Gilgamesh was epic
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Computers use **bits (0/1)** as the most basic unit of information; 8 bits = 1 byte.
- Memory is split into **volatile (RAM)** for short-term and **non-volatile (HDD/SSD)** for long-term storage.
- **Binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal** are all positional number systems used in computing.
- **ASCII and Unicode/UTF-8** map numbers to text characters so computers can represent letters, digits, and symbols.
- Files are just **sequences of bytes**, with text files interpreted as characters and binary files as raw data.
## Week 3 - Structure of Text
- Text in computing is structured with **lines & whitespace**; the newline (ASCII 10) ends a line, indentation groups ideas.
- **Special characters** have meanings (e.g., `#`, `*`, `<`, `>`); use **escaping** (Markdown `\#`, HTML `&lt;`) to show them literally.
- **Markup languages** add meaning/presentation: **Markdown** (lightweight, readable) vs **HTML/XML/YAML** (more explicit structure).
- **Structured data** uses text formats: **JSON** (objects/arrays) and **XML** (tags) for serializing data humans can read and machines can parse.
- *GitHub + Markdown*: edit `README.md`, preview rendering, and **commit** changes to track versions and collaborate.
## Week 4 - Manipulating Text & Text Editors
- **Master the keyboard**: touch typing + ergonomic setup reduces strain and frees brainpower for problem-solving.
- **Modifier keys & shortcuts**: make Ctrl/Cmd + C/V/Z, **Ctrl/Cmd + F** (find), **Ctrl/Cmd + H** (replace) second nature.
- **Tools, not toys**: use **text editors/IDEs** for code (plain text, syntax tools); avoid **word processors** for source files.
- **Search at scale**: leverage **find/replace with Regex** and **multi-cursor** editing to make precise, bulk changes fast.
- **VS Code & GitHub**: use Markdown preview, Git integration, and open repos in-browser via **github.dev**; publish simple sites with **GitHub Pages**.
## Week 5 - Command Line Interfaces
- **CLI = text-based interface**: type commands, get responses; originated from teletype machines before screens.
- **Structure of a command**: `command [options] [arguments]` (prompt → command → arguments → flags).
- **Why use CLI**: faster for repetitive tasks, enables automation (scripts), works remotely with low resources, and offers precise control.
- **Core commands**: `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `cat`, `less`, `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`, plus utilities like `grep`, `wc`, and network tools (`ping`, `ssh`).
- **Redirection & piping**: `>` writes output to a file, `>>` appends, `|` passes output into another command — foundation of the Unix philosophy.
